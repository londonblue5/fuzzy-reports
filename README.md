Reports of the 4 projects implemented in MATLAB of undergraduate course computer intelligence of ECE AUTH, as taught in the spring semester of 2025. Central themes are fuzzy sets, systems, logic controllers, training neuro fuzzy inference systems, backpropagation, Mean Square Error, Error Matrix, machine learning, training - validation - check datasets

Car control: car 2d simulation performing navigation avoiding walls using fuzzy controller

Classification: training and classification on Haberman's Survival dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

FLC: fuzzy logic controller for controlling a seperately excited dc motor following a reference signal (angular speed)

Regression: training and regression of TSK (Takagi-Sugeno-Kang) fuzzy models, using UCI Repository Airfoil Self-Noise dataset
